    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <p>DiscordNomic is a Discord server used for playing
    <a href="https://nomic.net">Nomic</a>: a game about law, self-modification
    and paradox.</p>

    <p>This webpage serves as records for the game, including a logical
    organization for its rules, its players and information about the current
    and past games.</p>

    <h2 id="immutable">Immutable rules</h2>

    <p id="311"><strong>311. Supremacy of the rules</strong><br/>
    All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form
    in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect
    whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
    (immutable) and 201-213 (mutable).</p>

    <p>All rule changes enacted in previous games and interim periods are also
    in effect.</p>

    <p>This rule takes precedence over, and nullifies, 101.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#game-1-101">Rule 101</a>,<br/>
    <a href="#game-2-101">
      Amended in the interlude between games 1 and 2</a>,<br/>
    Amended by <a href="#p311">Proposal 311</a> (transmuted by
    <a href="#p312">Proposal 312</a>)</p>

    <p id="102"><strong>102. Definition of immutable and mutable</strong><br/>
    Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are
    mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from
    immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be immutable or mutable
    regardless of their numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be
    transmuted regardless of their numbers.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#102">Rule 102</a></p>

    <p id="103"><strong>103. Definition of rule-change</strong><br/>
    A rule-change is any of the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule;</li>
      <li>the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment of a mutable rule; or</li>
      <li>the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule or vice versa.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new rules
    are mutable; immutable rules, as long as they are immutable, may not be
    amended or repealed; mutable rules, as long as they are mutable, may be
    amended or repealed; any rule of any status may be transmuted; no rule is
    absolutely immune to change.)</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#103">Rule 103</a></p>

    <p id="104"><strong>104. Voting and adoption of rule-changes</strong><br/>
    All rule-changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will
    be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#104">Rule 104</a></p>

    <p id="105"><strong>105. Universal and mandatory suffrage</strong></br>
    Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate
    in every vote on rule-changes.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#105">Rule 105</a></p>

    <p id="106"><strong>106. Writing of rule-changes</strong><br/>
    All proposed rule-changes shall be written down before they are voted on.
    If they are adopted, they shall guide play in the form in which they were
    voted on.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#106">Rule 106</a></p>

    <p id="107"><strong>107. Applying of rule-changes</strong><br/>
    No rule-change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion
    of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states
    otherwise. No rule-change may have retroactive application.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#107">Rule 107</a></p>

    <p id="108"><strong>108. Numbering of rule-changes</strong><br/>
    Each proposed rule-change shall be given a number for reference. The
    numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule-change proposed in the proper
    way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the
    proposal is adopted.</p>

    <p>If a rule is repealed and reenacted, it receives the number of the
    proposal to reenact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives
    the number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is
    amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the
    number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#108">Rule 108</a></p>

    <p id="109"><strong>109. Transmutation of immutable rules into mutable
      rules</strong><br/>
    Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be
    adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters.
    Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a
    proposal to take effect.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#109">Rule 109</a></p>

    <p id="110"><strong>110. Precedence of immutable rules</strong><br/>
    In a conflict between a mutable and an immutable rule, the immutable rule
    takes precedence and the mutable rule shall be entirely void. For the
    purposes of this rule a proposal to transmute an immutable rule does not
    "conflict" with that immutable rule.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#110">Rule 110</a></p>

    <p id="111"><strong>111. Debating of rule-changes</strong><br/>
    If a rule-change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or
    destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of two or more
    rule-changes compounded or is an amendment that makes no difference, or
    if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may
    suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A
    reasonable time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides
    the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and, unless the
    Judge has been asked to do so, also decides the time to end debate and
    vote.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#111">Rule 111</a></p>

    <p id="112"><strong>112. Winning of the game</strong><br/>
    The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from
    achieving n points to any other state of affairs. The magnitude of n and
    the means of earning points may be changed, and rules that establish a
    winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are
    mutable) be amended or repealed.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#112">Rule 112</a></p>

    <p id="113"><strong>113. Forfeiting</strong><br/>
    A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue
    to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the
    judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#113">Rule 113</a></p>

    <p id="114"><strong>114. Minimum of mutable rules</strong><br/>
    There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of
    rule-changes must never become completely impermissible.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#114">Rule 114</a></p>

    <p id="115"><strong>115. Scope of rule-changes</strong><br/>
    Rule-changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule-changes are
    as permissible as other rule-changes. Even rule-changes that amend or
    repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule-change or type of
    move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or
    self-application of a rule.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#115">Rule 115</a></p>

    <p id="116"><strong>116. Scope of the rules</strong><br/>
    Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and
    unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is
    permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly
    permits it.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#116">Rule 116</a></p>

    <h3 id="players">Players</h3>

    <p id="301"><strong>301. Playing order</strong><br/>
    Players shall alternate according to the list maintained in the Discord
    channel <code>#playing-order</code>, taking one whole turn apiece. Players
    who join after the start of the game shall be added onto the end of this
    list, which may otherwise only be updated by vote. Turns may not be skipped
    or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with
    zero points.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#201">Rule 201</a>,<br/>
    Amended, <a href="#p301d">Proposal 301D</a></p>

    <h3 id="turns">Turns &amp; game time</h3>

    <p id="202"><strong>202. Parts of a turn</strong><br/>
    One turn consists of two parts in this order:
    <ol>
      <li>proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, and</li>
      <li>throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to
        one's score.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In mail and computer games, instead of throwing a die, players subtract
    291 from the ordinal number of their proposal and multiply the result by
    the fraction of favorable votes it received, rounded to the nearest
    integer. (This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player, with
    the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points are awarded for
    more popular proposals.)</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#202">Rule 202</a></p>

    <p id="320"><strong>320. Regular leave from Nomic</strong><br/>
    Nomic is closed every week for a time period from Saturday 01:00 to Sunday
    09:00 (reckoned in UTC). No action taken during this time is considered part
    of the Nomic game. Outside of this time, game actions are as valid as in the
    rest of the rule set.</p>

    <h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

    <p id="211"><strong>211. Ordinal precedence</strong><br/>
    If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more
    immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest
    ordinal number takes precedence.</p>

    <p>If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that
    it defers to another rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over
    another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the
    numerical method for determining precedence.</p>

    <p>If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to
    defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#211">Rule 211</a></p>

    <h3 id="voting">Voting</h3>

    <p id="207"><strong>207. Equal representation</strong><br/>
    Each player always has exactly one vote.</p>

    <h3 id="after-vote">After a vote</h3>

    <p id="302"><strong>302. Rule change adoption</strong><br/>
    A rule-change is adopted if and only if the vote meets at least a simple
    majority of all eligible players. If a rule-change acquires unanimous
    support, then a quantity of bonus points equal to half the assenting votes
    (rounded down) is awarded to the player.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#203">Rule 203</a>,<br/>
    Amended, <a href="#p302">Proposal 302</a></p>

    <p id="205"><strong> 205. Effectiveness</strong><br/>
    An adopted rule-change takes full effect at the moment of the completion
    of the vote that adopted it.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#205">Rule 205</a></p>

    <p id="206"><strong>206. Unsuccessful turn penalty</strong><br/>
    When a proposed rule-change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses
    10 points.</p>

    <p>Initial set, <a href="#206">Rule 206</a></p>

    <p id="304"><strong>304. No opposition reward</strong><br/>
    Rule 204 is repealed. Players shall not receive any points for having voted
    against a rule that passed.</p>

    <p>Enacted, <a href="#p304">Proposal 304</a></p>

    <p id="319"><strong>Proposal 319</strong><br/>
    In calculating the score for successful legislation, take the difference
    between the highest scoring player and the player who just passed
    legislation. Then divide by the number of players, and reward that quotient,
    rounded down to the nearest integer, as additional points.</p>

    <p>For example, if the player with the highest score has 70 points, and I
    have 0, this rule would grant me <code>(70 - 0) / 7 = 10</code> additional
    points. Further, this rule is only applicable while there are a number of
    players greater than three.</p>

    <p>Enacted, <a href="#p319">Proposal 319</a></p>

    <h3 id="judgement">Judgement</h3>

    <p id="316"><strong>316. Judges</strong><br/>
    If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or
    application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is to be
    the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement for the purposes of this
    rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is
    called invoking Judgment.</p>

    <p>When Judgment has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or
    her turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.</p>

    <p>The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a 2/3 majority vote of the
    other players taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's Judgment is
    overruled, then the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes
    the new Judge for the question, and so on, except that no player is to be
    Judge during his or her own turn or during the turn of a team-mate.</p>

    <p>Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising
    from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as to his
    or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.</p>

    <p>New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges
    may, however, settle only those questions on which the players currently
    disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in which Judgment was
    invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules
    then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on
    the point at issue, then the Judge shall consider game-custom and the
    spirit of the game before applying other standards.</p>

    <p id="306"><strong>306. Honorifics</strong><br/>
    Replaces Rule 305.</p> 

    <p>Each player possesses a variable set of honorific title, henceforth
    Honorifics, initially having none.</p>

    <p>Honorifics may only be granted or renounced according to the text of
    rules.</p>

    <p>A player may renounce any of their own Honorifics, unless doing so would
    violate a rule.</p>

    <p>When a player refers to another by name in the channel
    <code>#gameplay</code>, they must include all of that player's Honorifics
    prior to the name itself. For each Honorific not included, the offending
    player must forfeit 10 points. The offending player subsequently obtains the
    Honorific "Wrong Dishonourable", which they must not renounce for at least
    three turns.</p>

    <p>Each player possesses the Honorific 'Sir' if and only if it is currently
    their turn. This may not be renounced.</p>

    <p>Each player possesses the Honorific 'Big Judge Man' if and only if they
    are currently Judge. This may not be renounced.</p>

    <p id="308"><strong>308. Victorious Honorifics</strong><br/>
    The winner of the previous game (henceforth winner) possesses a special type
    of Honorific for the length of the current game. They may not renounce this
    Honorific.</p>

    <p>Whenever this player is referred to, an Honorific that has not previously
    been used to describe them during the course of the current game must be
    used, in addition to any Honorifics they would otherwise possess.</p>

    <p>This Honorific must either refer to the fact that the player won the
    previous game or otherwise praise them generally.</p>

    To lighten the gentiles.</p>

    <p>The Nomic Faith is hereby defined as the state religion of this
    game-state, Nomeland. </p>

    <p>The head of the Nomic Faith, the Supreme Nome, bears the same honorific
    as his title for the length of his office.</p>

    <p>The Nomic Court is a Nomic legal institution headed by the Supreme Nome.
    Its decisions are binding on all followers of the Nomic Faith, but not
    binding upon gentiles who belong not to the faith. A decision of the Nome
    Court, once promulgated, becomes a part of the Code of Nomic Law, which
    may not be modified any other way.</p>

    <p>For the purposes of arbitration, the body of Nomic Law has the same
    authority as this civil law introducing the Nomic Faith.</p>

    <p>Believers in the Nomic Faith may not take rule disputes between
    themselves to any institution but the Nomic Court, and must follow Nomic
    Law.</p>

    <p>To convert to the Nomic Faith, believers must declare their trust in the
    Supreme Nome. Every player who begins their turn a believer is to be paid
    2000 milipedés [sic] by the Supreme Nome. If the Supreme Nome cannot afford
    this, he may and must abdicate.  A player may either join or leave the faith
    at most one time on their turn only, and must settle all outstanding

    <p>The Nomic Faith is hereby defined as the state religion of this

    <p>The head of the Nomic Faith, the Supreme Nome, bears the same honorific
    as his title for the length of his office.</p>

    <p>The Nomic Court is a Nomic legal institution headed by the Supreme Nome.
    Its decisions are binding on all followers of the Nomic Faith, but not
    binding upon gentiles who belong not to the faith. A decision of the Nome
    Court, once promulgated, becomes a part of the Code of Nomic Law, which
    may not be modified any other way.</p>

    <p>For the purposes of arbitration, the body of Nomic Law has the same
    authority as this civil law introducing the Nomic Faith.</p>

    <p>Believers in the Nomic Faith may not take rule disputes between
    themselves to any institution but the Nomic Court, and must follow Nomic
    Law.</p>

    <p>To convert to the Nomic Faith, believers must declare their trust in the
    Supreme Nome. Every player who begins their turn a believer is to be paid
    2000 milipedés [sic] by the Supreme Nome. If the Supreme Nome cannot afford
    this, he may and must abdicate.  A player may either join or leave the faith
    at most one time on their turn only, and must settle all outstanding
    disagreements before doing so.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Nome may voluntarily relinquish his position to another
    believer at any time if he should so desire. Only one person may hold the
    title of Supreme Nome at a time. If the Supreme Nome's position is
    empty:</p>

        answer.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, any player who can afford to pay the Nome faith payment for
        the current player may become the Supreme Nome.</li>

    <p>Commentary: <em>nikolasnewaccount</em> won by exploiting an loophole in
    <a href="#116">Rule 116</a>, using the fact that addition of points to
    oneself was not regulated to immediately grant themself 200 points and win
    the game, as judged by <em>ardonis4</em>. Also discussed was the
    acceptability of this action taking place during another player's turn: it
    was judged that <a href="#202">Rule 202</a> does not restrict actions only
    to the two parts specified therein, due to the provision of discussion and
    Judgement elsewhere.</p>

    <h3 id="game-2">Game 2</h3>

    <p>Timeframe: 2025 Apr 02–05.</p>

    <p>Winner: <em>torst_skagen</em>, after 2 turns</p>

    <p>Commentary: <em>torst_skagen</em> unintentionally won, when
    <em>various2111</em> exploited the aspect of <a href="#305">Rule 305</a>
    that awarded points for forgetting Honorifics to the victim <em>per
    Honorific missed, per name</em>, by naming <em>torst_skagen</em> 20 times in
    a message, thereby allowing him to obtain the winning 200 points.</p>

    <p>Commentary: <em>zenithseeker7</em> won, once again due to
    <em>various2111</em>'s ingenious exploits. While acting as Judge on
    <em>zenithseeker's</em> round, he took advantage of the fact that a Judge's
    ruling cannot be overturned without a unanimous vote from all players
    (<a href="#212">Rule 212</a>) to arbitrarily interpret a rule as he wished,
    resulting in <em>zenithseeker7</em> being granted 2000 points.</p>
