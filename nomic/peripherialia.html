    <p>Summary:</p>

    <p>Proposal to introduce mandatory Honorifics, and attach relevant
    punishments, into this Great Nomic Game.</p>

    <p>Preamble:</p>

    <p>Noting that the Diction used in our great and belov'd Nomic Discord
    Server, though Civil, often takes on a positively Banal character, a Rule on
    the nature of Language in the Game, affix'd here, is to be proposed, and, if
    the People, possessing willing and quick Minds, and an excellent balance of
    the Four Humours, permit, this law shall go down to Posterity ans the First
    in a sequence of many Great and Necessary such Laws, and therefore allow the
    people to Observe the wisdom of the Virtuism-Longism-Contrarianism Party
    whereupon these Laws were erected.</p>

    <p>With these statements being self-evident, it is now derived, via Logical
    Reasoning alone, indeed, with Euclid looking upon in Awe at this Pre-Ramble
    of sorts, that the first area of the Tongue to be reformed is the Name. How
    can players of a Civilised Nomic Game come to respect each other, and not
    fall into hurling barbarous &amp; vitriolic terms at one another, without
    proper Weight affored to their Names? Hence a system of Honorific shall be
    the starting place for discussion to be Rectified.</p>

    <p>As a final statement, on the Etiquette of Honorifics, the author of this
    Preamble must express their Deep Detestation of laws acting to Acquire an
    Honorific for oneself: thought it be not a binding Rule, I implore my fellow
    Nomicians that this be the common practice of the land.</p>
